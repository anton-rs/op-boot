A full Optimism Node, built on [op-reth](https://github.com/anton-rs/op-reth) and [op-node](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-node). See [the docs](./docs/src/README.md) to get started.

Largely inspired by [@smartcontracts](https://github.com/smartcontracts)'s [simple-optimism-node](https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node).
